      | Thanks to @posabsolute as this plugin was originally a fork of
      | jQuery Validation Engine though it has now been completely rewritten.
      | Many good ideas we're reimplemented like the list of validators inside
      | an attribute. New goals are to be

      | , easily extendable and to have a 
      | cleaner code base.
